# tech-challenge-toystory-4

This is a completed project!

I truly struggled a lot with the positing with the poster - I have never played with absolute positiong.

In terms of everything else I had issues with flexbox as I was nesting too many things causing my brain to explode.

And the final section was nothing but an uphill battle. I had to watch COUNTLESS VIDEOS to try and make sense of using javascript to submit a comment.

In the end, it's a finished product, and I got here somehow ahahah

Thanks,

B
